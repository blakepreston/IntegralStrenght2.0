        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Austin Bohnsack. I am a University of Montana graduate with a bachelorâ€™s
            degree in Health and Human Performance with a concentration on exercise science. I am also a NSCA
            Certified Personal Trainer and a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist. </p>
            
            <p>Growing up I played baseball for Westside Little League and then for the Missoula Mavericks. I
            went on to play baseball at Central Washington University and at North Iowa Area Community College
            (NIACC). During my time at NIACC we were ranked 14th in the nation.
            Unfortunately, my college baseball career was cut short due to a torn UCL which required
            Tommy John and hundreds of hours in rehab to fix my elbow/shoulder. This led into an internship with
            Chad Kay, a physical therapist who specializes in shoulder rehab. Upon completion of this internship I
            got into powerlifting. For the past two years I have been working with Dale Garlitz, a world record
            holding powerlifter, to further my powerlifting knowledge.
            I became a strength coach/trainer to help people play sports at the highest level, and most
            importantly to train them in ways that reduce injuries as much as possible.</p></p>
